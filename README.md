### S3 Image Uploader

Dead simple image uploader to AWS S3. Converts images to jpeg and resized them to 50% of their resolution. Drag/drop and that's about it.

WARNING: 99.99% autogenerated code using Cursor.

### Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure AWS keys. Yes, this is bad, so set up your IAM user to the correct policies and limit to only the bucket you want to upload.

```bash
export VITE_AWS_REGION=<region>
export VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<access key>
export VITE_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=<access key>
export VITE_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<secret key>
export VITE_AWS_BUCKET_NAME=<bucket to be managed>
```

3. Run using

```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open http://localhost:5173
